                Thus spoke Tom Trevorrick, senior partner of the firm of
                Trevorrick, Pengelly & Co., shipbreakers, of Polkyll, near
                Falmouth. He was a tall, powerfully-built man, standing six feet
                two and a half inches in his socks, red-haired, florid featured,
                with a high though receding forehead and a heavy protruding jaw.
                His rich deep voice had a plausible ring about it—a compelling,
                masterful yet persuasive tone, that had largely influenced the
                shareholders of Trevorrick, Pengelly & Co. to part with their
                money with the absolute certainty of a pre-war ten per cent.
                return. Paul Pengelly, aged thirty-three, or three years older
                than the senior partner, was of different build and temperament.
                Trevorrick represented the Celtic strain of Cornishmen; Pengelly
                had dark curly hair and sallow features—legacies of an Iberian
                ancestor, one of a handful of survivors from a vessel of the
                Spanish Armada that had been cast ashore on the rock-bound
                Lizard. History does not relate why the Cornish wreckers spared
                the lives of the olive-featured mariners, but it does record
                that the shipwrecked Spaniards took wives of the Cornish maids,
                and lived and died in the country of their adoption. Pengelly
                was slow of speech, stolid in action save when roused to anger.
                Of an argumentative nature, he acted as a foil to his partner's
                exuberance. If Trevorrick suggested a certain course, Pengelly
                almost invariably went dead against it, not that he disapproved
                of the scheme, but simply as a matter of habit. He was secretive
                and cautious; but he never hesitated to do an underhand action
                if he felt reasonably secure from detection. He was a man of
                many parts—a jack-of-all-trades and master of a few. Given to
                building castles in the air, he would soar to dizzy heights in
                planning fantastic schemes. Some of them might take definite
                shape; then, almost without warning, he would "chuck his hand
                in" and cast about for something else. Eighteen months
                previously, Trevorrick and Pengelly had met for the first time.
                Trevorrick had just left the Royal Navy. He had been a
                lieutenant-commander attached to the Portsmouth submarine
                flotilla. He had not resigned under the favourable terms offered
                by My Lords to redundant officers; he had not been "axed" under
                the Geddes Scheme. He had been courtmartialled and dismissed
                from the Service under circumstances that could not be termed
                extenuating. Trevorrick was at a loose end when he encountered
                Pengelly. He had a limited amount of capital. So had Pengelly.
                The latter's latest scheme appealed to the
                ex-lieutenant-commander. Just then, hundreds of ships of all
                sizes were being sold out of the Service for breaking-up
                purposes. There was money to be made out of the business, with
                very little capital required for plant, while surplus destroyers
                and submarines could be bought at a flat rate of one pound per
                ton, subject to the condition that they had to be broken up. Of
                the hundreds, nay, thousands of people who patronise the little
                steamers plying between Falmouth and Truro—or Malpas, according
                to the state of the tide few are likely to notice a small creek
                on the starboard hand of the picturesque river Fal. Fewer still
                know it by name. Its entrance is narrow, between steeply rising,
                heavily wooded ground. Although barely twenty-five yards in
                width across its mouth, it carries nearly thirty feet of water
                at Springs. Two hundred yards up, the creek widens out. One bank
                retains its precipitous, tree-clad nature. The other dips,
                forming a wide bay, with a flat belt of ground between the shore
                and the high ground beyond. On this site, hidden from the Fal by
                a bend in the channel, stood a derelict shipyard. A century ago,
                when Falmouth was at the height of its prosperity as a
                packet-station, the shipyard teemed with activity. It enjoyed a
                brief and illusory spell of life during the Great War, when it
                again sank into obscurity and neglect. The two slipways were
                left to rot, two tidal docks were allowed to silt up. The
                buildings were ruinous and leaky. The whole concern was in the
                hands of the Official Receiver. To the delectable spot came
                Trevorrick and Pengelly. They looked at it. Trevorrick lost no
                time in declaring that it was "the" place; Pengelly asserted
                that it was not. The big man had his way, and thus the Polkyll
                Creek Shipbreaking Company came into being. They started
                modestly upon their enterprise. The heaviest item for plant was
                the purchase of an oxygen-acetylene apparatus. At first, ten
                hands were engaged. Pengelly wanted to obtain them locally.
                Trevorrick, as usual, overruled him, and as a result inserted in
                a Plymouth paper an advertisement for ex-Naval and Mercantile
                Marine men. They received shoals of replies and could pick and
                choose, without having to pay Trade Union rates. "We'll have
                unmarried men," declared the senior partner. "They won't be
                wanting to run away home every five minutes." "Married men are
                more likely to stick to their jobs," objected Pengelly. "No one
                but a born fool would chuck up a job nowadays," retorted
                Trevorrick. "They are none too plentiful." In due course, the
                shipbreaking yard began to function. A destroyer and a submarine
                were purchased at Devonport and towed round to Falmouth and up
                the Fal to Polkyll. The scrap metal was sent up to Truro in
                barges and thence transferred to goods train for the Welsh
                smelting works. So profitable was the venture that three more
                vessels were bought for demolition, twenty additional hands
                taken on, and the firm of Trevorrick and Pengelly became a
                limited liability company. So far, things were going smoothly.
                The two principals got on amicably, which was rather to be
                wondered at, since Trevorrick was apt to boast that he had had
                heaps of friends and had never been able to keep one of them. No
                doubt, the totally dissimilar physical and mental
                characteristics of each kept them in a state of mutual docility;
                but already Pengelly was tiring of the monotonous work, and
                Trevorrick was scheming to get away to a livelier spot than the
                dead-and-alive Polkyll Creek. Then, slowly but surely, came the
                slump. The shareholders had their first dividends—ten per
                cent.—paid out of the capital. Another dividend was shortly due
                and there was no possible chance of it being forthcoming, unless
                Trevorrick and Pengelly drew upon their capital—a step that each
                was firmly determined not to take.
